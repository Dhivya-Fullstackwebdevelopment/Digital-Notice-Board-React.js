Project: Digital Notice Board & Complaint BoxThis project is a web-based communication platform for colleges. It replaces physical notice boards with a digital dashboard and provides a safe, anonymous way for students to report issues (ragging, facility problems, harassment) without fear.Here is a detailed breakdown of how you can build this using HTML, CSS, JS, PHP, and SQL.1. Core Features (The "What")A. The Digital Notice Board (Admin to Student)Admins (Staff/HODs) can log in and post circulars, exam schedules, or holiday announcements.Students see these notices on their dashboard immediately.Categories: Notices can be tagged (e.g., "Examination", "Sports", "General", "Urgent").Attachments: Admins can upload PDF timetables or images (handled via PHP file upload).B. The Complaint Box (Student to Admin)Grievance Submission: Students can submit complaints regarding hostel food, ragging, sanitation, or faculty issues.Anonymous Mode: A checkbox option ("Hide my Identity") that prevents the student's name/ID from being saved in the database or shown to the admin.Status Tracking: Students can track if their complaint is "Pending," "In Progress," or "Resolved."2. User Roles & ModulesRoleResponsibilitiesAdmin (Principal/HOD)Login, Post/Edit/Delete Notices, View Complaints, Update Complaint Status (e.g., mark as "Resolved").StudentLogin, View Notices (filter by date/category), Submit Complaints, Track Complaint Status.3. Technical Implementation (The "How")Frontend (HTML, CSS, JS)Dashboard: Use a Sidebar layout (CSS Flexbox/Grid).Left Side: Navigation (Notices, Complaints, Profile).Right Side: The main content area where notices appear as "Cards".Forms:Notice Form: Title, Description, Date, Category (Dropdown), File Upload.Complaint Form: Subject, Description, Category, "Post Anonymously" (Checkbox).JavaScript: Use JS for form validation (e.g., ensuring the description isn't empty) and for filtering notices (e.g., clicking "Sports" only shows sports notices without reloading the page).Backend (PHP)login.php: Handles session management. Checks if the user is a Student or Admin.post_notice.php: Takes the form data and inserts it into the SQL notices table.submit_complaint.php: Logic to check if the "Anonymous" checkbox is ticked.If Checked: Insert NULL or 'Anonymous' into the student_id column.If Not Checked: Insert the logged-in user's ID.Database (SQL Tables)You will need 3 main tables in your MySQL database:1. Table: usersid (Primary Key)usernamepassword (Hashed)role (Enum: 'admin', 'student')2. Table: noticesnotice_idtitledescriptioncategory (e.g., 'Exam', 'General')attachment_path (for PDFs/Images)created_at (Timestamp)3. Table: complaintscomplaint_idstudent_id (Foreign Key linked to users, Nullable for anonymity)subjectdescriptionstatus (Default: 'Pending')date_posted4. Why is this a "Trending" Project?Social Relevance: It solves a real problem (students often fear reporting issues).Paperless Campus: It supports the "Green Campus" initiative by reducing paper notices.Privacy Logic: Implementing the anonymous feature shows the examiner you understand logic and database privacy, not just simple data entry.Would you like the SQL code to create these tables?  gave only frontend using react+tailwind+vite
